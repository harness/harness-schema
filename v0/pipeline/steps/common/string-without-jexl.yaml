title: string-without-jexl
description: |
  A plain string type that explicitly excludes JEXL expressions (e.g., <+input>, <+variable>).
  
  This is used in oneOf schemas alongside common-jexl to prevent validation conflicts.
  Without the 'not' constraint, both schemas would match JEXL expressions since both are 
  type: string, causing oneOf validation to fail (oneOf requires exactly one match).
  
  The 'not' pattern ensures mutual exclusivity:
  - This schema matches: plain strings that don't start with <+
  - common-jexl matches: JEXL expressions like <+input>, <+variable>, etc.
  
  Use this when you need a field that accepts either a literal string OR a JEXL expression.
type: string
not:
  pattern: "^<\\+.*>.*$"
