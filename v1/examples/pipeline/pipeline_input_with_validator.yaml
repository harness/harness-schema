# For the following inputs, we haven't provided a value so, it's value will be asked during the runtime.
# Default value for input-1 is abc and for input-2, it is 1, so, if user doesn't provide a value during runtime,
# input-1 will be set as abc and input-2 will be set as 1.
# Also, there's a validation that value of input-1 should be one of a, b, abc
# for input-2, it should be a single digit number from 1 to 9
